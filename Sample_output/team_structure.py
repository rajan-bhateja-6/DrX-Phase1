        🎯 Recommendations for Lean Startups
        If you're starting lean:

        Combine Product Manager + UX Designer roles

        Hire full-stack developers who can handle frontend & backend

        Use Firebase or Supabase to cut down backend/devops work

        Outsource motion design or QA temporarily
